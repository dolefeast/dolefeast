Hey!

I'm a physics undergrad student greatly interested in simulating the things I see in class. Simulations are kind of the only thing 
I'm capable of doing, besides basic data analysis. 

Since this is the first year I saw about quantum stuff, I would love to start simulating non-classical systems, though I don't know 
how. That's something for the future me to handle.
